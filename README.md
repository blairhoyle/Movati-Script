# Movati-Script

Open up the content.js file in the folder 
Setup whatever time you want to signup at the top of the code. 
It's set to "5:00pm-6:00pm" currently but you can set it to whatever you want. Has to be in that specific format though. 
workoutTime.setHours(16,0,10) change the "16" here to match an hour before the time you want to signup. So here it's 16 for 4pm to signup for the 5pm time

Open up your chrome browser 
Click on settings in the top right then More Tools --> Extensions 
In the top left click Load unpacked and choose the Movati folder you've downloaded 
Once it's unpacked. Open the movati schedule page where you would be clicking to signup for a time and reload the page 
If you want to check if it's going to work go to the settings again click on More Tool --> Developer Tools and open up the console 
the console will show you if there's any errors and will also output in how many ms the script will run
